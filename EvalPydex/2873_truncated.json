For example, 0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are the Armstrong numbers.\nWrite a program to check if an input number is an Armstrong number. The output should match the format as given in the example below.\n\nNOTE: Use input() without any prompt to read the number.\n\n\nInput: 371\nOutput: Sum of Cubes is 371.

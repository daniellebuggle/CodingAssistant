To decrypt, you need to perform an operation between two integers, say A and B, as described below - \n\n1) Let X and Y be the numbers obtained by REVERSING A and B. For example, the reverse of 123 is 321, and the reverse of 320 is 23 (leading zeroes are discarded)\n\n2) If both X and Y are PRIME, then the answer is X + Y\n\n3) If EXACTLY ONE of X and Y is PRIME, then the answer is A +  B\n\n4) Otherwise, the answer is A * B\n\nYour task is to write a program to help you perform this operation.\n\nInput: Two COMMA-separated integers A and B. There can be any number of white-spaces in the input.\nOutput : A single integer that is the result of applying the operation described above on the input integers.\n\nConstraints:\n$1 \\leq A, B \\leq 10000$\n\nExample:\nInput:\n142 123\nOutput:\n265\n\nExplanation : The reverse of 142 is 241 (prime) and that of 123 is 321 (not prime).
